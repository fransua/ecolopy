EcoloPy-UNTBgen
***************

**a Python package to test for Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and biogeography in Large dataset.**
EcoloPy deal with species abundance and diversity data. It allows to fit this data into ecological models and implements some statistical tests.
It is able to deal with large dataset like genetic element content of mammalian genomes.

The package was implemented in the context of a study of the distribution of genetic elements in Eukaryotic genomes :ref:`[Serra2013]<citation>`.

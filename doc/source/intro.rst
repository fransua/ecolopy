What is EcoloPy?
================

EcoloPy is a Python package similar to UNTB in R, to infer neutrality of an ecosysdtem distribution of species.
Ewens and Etienne neutral models are implemented.

Why an other package?
=====================

EcoloPy implements basically the same function as UNTB from R or the programs written by Etienne in gp/pari, but
takes advantage of GMP library (a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic) in order to compute the fit of
Etienne model for large datasets.
